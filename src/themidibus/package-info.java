/**
 * The MidiBus provides a simple way to access and interact with installed MIDI system resources, although it's especially designed to be used with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, it could easily be adapted for use in any java program.
 * <p>
 * <b style="color:red;">IMPORTANT</b>: Mac users must install <a href="http://www.humatic.de/htools/mmj.htm">mmj, <i>a Mac OS X universal binary java MIDI subsystem</i></a> - or an equivalent third party MIDI subsystem - because apple does not provide build-in MIDI support for java. Mmj is recommended because it works, it's free and it's almost open source (CC licence), although there is no 64 bit version yet (donate on their website and there will be!).
 * <p>
 * Keeping with the spirit of Processing's easy to use sketching/prototyping style, the MidiBus offers a clean and simple way to get at MIDI ressources. Getting the basic functionality of the MidiBus up and running in a sketch is a matter of only a few line. The {@link themidibus.MidiBus} class provides everything needed send and receive MIDI inside a sketch. To jump right into the Midibus, either refer to the paragraph titled "Typical Implementation, Simple" in the description for the {@link themidibus.MidiBus} class, or check out the code examples distributed with this library. 
 * <hr><p>
 * It is important to understand that the MidiBus offers little functionality that isn't available from Java's native <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/package-summary.html">javax.sound.midi</a> package. Anyone interested in working with MIDI in Java should take the time to read the documentation for the <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/package-summary.html">javax.sound.midi</a>. It offers a more full featured and flexible alternative to this package, although it does do so at the cost of added complexity. In addition, it may be worthwhile to skim <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/sound/index.html">the "official" Java Tutorial</a> for the javax.sound.* packages.
 * <p>
 * <b style="color:red;">Note to Processing users:</b> The current version of Processing (Processing 1.0) doesn't allows java 1.5.0 (Java SE5) syntax when compiling within the IDE, but it does do the actual compiling using java 1.5.0 (Java SE5) meaning that many interfaces from the <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/package-summary.html">javax.sound.midi</a> package cannot be implemented in Processing sketches. [<i>see <a target="_blank" href="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=598">Processing Bug 598</a></i>]
